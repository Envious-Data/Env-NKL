# Env-NKL
A Keyboard without Nav Keys but has A numpad!.. therefore NKL = NavKeyLess

## About
As per usual it has a onboard RP2040 and is ISO UK, it does have split space.
the board is designed to fit SMD Nuts so ill likely solder those onto this board when I get around to ordering my own.

Ive yet to create the firmware but you'll see it in the Repo if I does
keep in mind all my README's dont get updated often.
