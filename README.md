# Env-NKL
A Keyboard without Nav Keys but has A numpad!.. therefore NKL = NavKeyLess

## About
I saw a coolermaster quickfire TK and thought, ok well I could make my own of a similar layout and see how people like it, It also lets me have navkeys and numpad in a board similar to TKL in width so we'll see.


The board is designed to fit SMD Nuts so ill likely solder those onto this board when I get around to ordering my own.

Ive yet to create the firmware but you'll see it in the Repo if I does
keep in mind all my README's dont get updated often.
